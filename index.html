                        <p class="answer1 answer">Errrr... What do you want to know?</p>

                        <p class="answer2 answer">I have around 10 years of management experience. Yeah, I manage like five fantasy football teams every year. I've seen every Jurasic Park movie hundreds of times. I know every single line, down to the last roar.</p>

                        <p class="answer3 answer">Let me answer your question with a question: What can you tell me about the pay?</p>

                        <p class="answer4 answer">I have the appropriate experience but I have a lot going on in my personal life.. Work/life balance is really important
                        to me. I am an aspiring YouTuber so Iâ€™m not sure if Iâ€™d be committed long term.</p>

                        <p class="answer5 answer">I have extensive experience in this field, I'm driven and I drive a hybrid.</p>

                        <h4 class="interviewQuestion">Why do you want to work for us?</h4>
                        <p class="answer1 answer"> Iâ€™ll be straight up with you because honesty is always the best policy. My bestie sent me a Snapchat showing off the new Fortnite skin he bought and I need to get it. Trust me, I wouldnâ€™t be here if I wasnâ€™t serious. I definitely need the money because I spent the last of my student loan on a Supreme t-shirt last week.</p>

                        <p class="answer2 answer">My parents really want me to start figuring my life out or something like that. </p>

                        <p class="answer3 answer">I have a couple friends that work for the company as well and I think it would be totally rad to be able to work together!</p>

                        <p class="answer4 answer">I'm bored of my current job, it's way too easy.</p>

                        <p class="answer5 answer">I have been in my current role for some time now, and I donâ€™t see much development if I stay. Iâ€™m looking to grow my career,
                        and I am ready for a new challenge. I've also heard great things about the company culture. Is it true that dogs are allowed in the office?!</p>

                        <h4 class="interviewQuestion">Why would you be a valuable asset to our team?</h4>
                        <p class="answer1 answer"> Now weâ€™re talkinâ€™! I was the captain of my ultimate frisbee team in grade 7 (based on a true story) so you already know I know how to lead a team. As for being valuableâ€¦ I was second runner up to the MVPâ€¦ NEXT QUESTION!</p>

                        <p class="answer2 answer">HELLO I WORK</p>

                        <p class="answer3 answer">HA I WAS RIGHT</p>

                        <p class="answer4 answer">4</p>

                        <p class="answer5 answer">5</p>

                        <h4 class="interviewQuestion">What are your strengths and weaknesses?</h4>
                        <p class="answer1 answer">First things first, amaryllis. Get it?! Like the flower?... That song by Iggy? No? Clearly humour is not a strength of mine. I make delicious tacos, I have around 70 Fortnite wins. My mom says that I am super talented.</p>

                        <p class="answer2 answer">HELLO I WORK</p>

                        <p class="answer3 answer">HA I WAS RIGHT</p>

                        <p class="answer4 answer">Strengths? Umâ€¦ Iâ€™m hard working, organized, energetic, and reliable. Weaknesses? Well.. I am a perfectionist, ya feel me?</p>

                        <p class="answer5 answer">In terms of strengths, I am very hard-working, reliable, energetic, and enthusiastic. For as long as I can remember, Iâ€™ve
                        enjoyed working and really look at my job as a place of comfort and safety. Weaknesses? Previously, Iâ€™ve been a little defensive
                        when it came to constructive criticism. Over the course of the last few years, itâ€™s really been a focus of mine, and with the help of
                        some great leaders, Iâ€™ve learned to overcome that.</p>

                        <h4 class="interviewQuestion">Where do you see yourself in five years?</h4>
                        <p class="answer1 answer">I'm thinking that in five years, I'll probably be trying to grow my personal brand as a hip-hop artist. I'm hoping you give me this job but this isn't going to be my career if you know what I mean. I've never been a kiss up. I-- it's just not how I operate. I mean I've always subscribed to the idea that if you really want to impress your boss, you go in there and you do mediocre work, half-heartedly.</p>

                        <p class="answer2 answer">HELLO I WORK</p>

                        <p class="answer3 answer">HA I WAS RIGHT</p>

                        <p class="answer4 answer">4</p>

                        <p class="answer5 answer">5</p>

                        <h4 class="interviewQuestion">Do you have any questions for us?</h4>
                        <p class="answer1 answer">Negative, boss! See ya next week!</p>

                        <p class="answer2 answer">How much would I be making? Oh and I have a follow-up question: how much do YOU make?</p>

                        <p class="answer3 answer">What's the dress code like? Just as a heads up. My doctor says I can't wear ties, button-up shirts, dress shoes, or dress pants.</p>

                        <p class="answer4 answer">What are the benefits? One of my friends gets a discount for Louis Vuitton through her work.</p>

                        <p class="answer5 answer">I do! How has your experience with the company been?</p>
