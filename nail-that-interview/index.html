                        <h4 class="interviewQuestion">Can you tell us about yourself?</h4>

                        <p class="answer1 answer">Errrr... What do you want to know?</p>
                        <p class="answer2 answer">I have around 10 years of management experience. Yeah, I manage like five fantasy football teams every year. I've seen every Jursasic Park movie hundreds of times. I know every single line, down to the last roar. I'm actually fairly positive I'm fluent in velocirapter at this point.</p>
                        <p class="answer3 answer">I could tell you a lot. But let me answer your question with a question: What can you tell me about the pay and do you pay for meals? If so, just know I'll want tacos the majority of the time.</p>
                        <p class="answer4 answer">I have the appropriate experience but I have a lot going on in my personal life.. Work/life balance is really important
                        to me. I am an aspiring YouTuber so Iâ€™m not sure if Iâ€™d be committed long term.</p>
                        <p class="answer5 answer">I have extensive experience in this field, I'm driven and I drive a hybrid.</p>

                        <!-- Interview Question 2 -->
                        <h4 class="interviewQuestion">Why do you want to work for us?</h4>

                        <p class="answer1 answer"> Iâ€™ll be straight up with you because honesty is always the best policy. My bestie sent me a Snapchat showing off the new Fortnite skin he bought and I need to get it. Trust me, I wouldnâ€™t be here if I wasnâ€™t serious. I definitely need the money because I spent the last of my student loan on a Supreme t-shirt last week.</p>
                        <p class="answer2 answer">My parents really want me to start figuring my life out or something like that. </p>
                        <p class="answer3 answer">I have a couple friends that work for the company as well and I think it would be totally rad to be able to work together!</p>
                        <p class="answer4 answer">I'm bored of my current job, it's way too easy.</p>
                        <p class="answer5 answer">I have been in my current role for some time now, and I donâ€™t see much development if I stay. Iâ€™m looking to grow my career,
                        and I am ready for a new challenge. I've also heard great things about the company culture. Is it true that dogs are allowed in the office?!</p>

                        <!-- Interview Question 3 -->
                        <h4 class="interviewQuestion">Why would you be a valuable asset to our team?</h4>

                        <p class="answer1 answer"> Now weâ€™re talkinâ€™! I was the captain of my ultimate frisbee team in grade 7 (based on a true story) so you already know I know how to lead a team. As for being valuableâ€¦ I was second runner up to the MVPâ€¦ NEXT QUESTION!</p>
                        <p class="answer2 answer">I think I'd be an asset just because I'm real, you know? I'm going to tell you things straight up and I have my priorities straight in life. I'm not even really sure what this position entails but what I am sure about is that I can do most things I set my mind to, if I feel like it.</p>
                        <p class="answer3 answer">I would get along with some of your employees because I know a few of them already. Let's just say if I was an Apple product, I'd be called iWork because it's true. I do indeed work. Don't ask about the specifics. Just know that I work. You need people that work. Enough said.</p>
                        <p class="answer4 answer">Well I'd bring you so much business. I'm lowkey pseudo-famous in Hamilton. I have over 8000 followers on my Instagram account... So... yeah. I'll post a pic of the office with a Buenos Aires filter and you'll see what happens.</p>
                        <p class="answer5 answer">I'd be an asset to the team because I always give 120%. I bake so I'd bring lots of goodies to the office. I've never backed down from a challenge and I love to learn.</p>

                        <!-- Interview Question 4 -->
                        <h4 class="interviewQuestion">What are your strengths and weaknesses?</h4>

                        <p class="answer1 answer">First things first, amaryllis. Get it?! Like the flower?... That song by Iggy? No? Clearly humour is not a strength of mine. I make delicious tacos, I have around 70 Fortnite wins. My mom says that I am super talented at everything.</p>
                        <p class="answer2 answer">I'm proficient with Instagram, Twitter, Snapchat, Facebook, Youtube, Netlfix, Tumblr, and Google. I'm basically a jack of all trades, except for trading. I suck at trading. I once traded a holographic Charizard for a lollipop.</p>
                        <p class="answer3 answer">I used to be Assistant to the Regional Manager at a paper company in Pennsylvania until my boss moved to Denver. I'm an incredible salesperson and I own a beet farm,</p>
                        <p class="answer4 answer">Strengths? Umâ€¦ Iâ€™m hard working, organized, energetic, and reliable. Weaknesses? Well.. I am a perfectionist, ya feel me?</p>
                        <p class="answer5 answer">In terms of strengths, I am very hard-working, reliable, energetic, and enthusiastic. For as long as I can remember, Iâ€™ve
                        enjoyed working and really look at my job as a place of comfort and safety. Weaknesses? Previously, Iâ€™ve been a little defensive
                        when it came to constructive criticism. Over the course of the last few years, itâ€™s really been a focus of mine, and with the help of
                        some great leaders, Iâ€™ve learned to overcome that.</p>

                        <!-- Interview Question 5 -->
                        <h4 class="interviewQuestion">Where do you see yourself in five years?</h4>

                        <p class="answer1 answer">I'm thinking that in five years, I'll probably be trying to grow my personal brand as a hip-hop artist. I'm hoping you give me this job but this isn't going to be my career if you know what I mean. I've never been a kiss up. It's just not how I operate. I mean I've always subscribed to the idea that if you really want to impress your boss, you go in there and you do mediocre work, half-heartedly.</p>
                        <p class="answer2 answer">I hope to be an established foodie. Stretch-goal: to see a Sasquatch.</p>
                        <p class="answer3 answer">I don't think that far ahead, bud.</p>
